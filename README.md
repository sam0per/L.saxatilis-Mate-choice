## Discussion  
Models of assortative mating typically assume that individuals mate with similar individuals with no difference in mating success. However, in natural populations where individuals mate assortatively, rare phenotypes undergo a mating disadvantage which can generate stabilsing sexual selection [@kirkpatrickandnuismer2004].
