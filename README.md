# Mating patterns in the intertidal species _Littorina saxatilis_
Bayesian inference on sexual selection and assortative mating between locally adapted populations. 

The mating analysis aims to predict the probability of mounting success and to directly estimate the parameters for choosiness (i.e., the strength of preference) and preference (i.e., the most preferred phenotype). These predictions are then used for the evaluation of the effects of sexual selection and assortative mating on the process of speciation with gene flow.

The data consists of a binary reposonse variable for mounting success whose relationship with shell size, shape, ecotype and shore is computed using a Bernoulli distribution in the Bayesian framework provided by the software [Stan](http://mc-stan.org).
